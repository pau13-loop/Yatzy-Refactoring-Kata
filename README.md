## Motivation

This project motivation is try to test all the learning that we have done since we started the course of _Web Development_. In this we will find non conventional and bad coding routines that we should be able to detect and correct.

## Content

The content of this project it's separed into two different directories **Domain** and **Resources**.

### Domain

In this direcotry we will find that it's subdivided into another two, **src** and **test**.

#### src

Inside _src_ we have the main program that alredy has been refactorized and is the completely functional.

---

#### test

Inside _test_ we have all the test cases that have been built to check the functionality of the program and if it runs correctly following the rules of the Yatzy.

### Resources

The directory of _resources_ how it tells the name has been built to keep all the external resources to the Yatzy program, in it we will find:

###### How to play Yatzy

In this document we have the rules of Yatzy in case we have never played before and we don't know how it works the logic of the game. It will have a clear explanation relationed with the program we built to help the user to understand how the program and test cases works.

---

###### Yatzy Code Smells

In this docuemnt we will find an original copy of the program of the game of Yatzy. We keep it to give the user a clue about how this kata should be resolved and because our teacher has asked if we can write down somwhere all the code smells we have been able to find in the original program. In this document we wrote all the code smells that we could find on the top of each function that conforms the yatzy program.

---

###### Yatzy Explained

This document have all the functions explained minutely one by one, in case any user is not able to understand the code that conforms the yatzy program game.
